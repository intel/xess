 * @brief Query XeSS model performance data for past executions.
 * This function is provided for backwards compatibility with previous XeSS versions and
 * and it's currently deprecated. Same functionality is provided by xessGetProfilingData
 * function from xess_debug.h. To enable performance collection,
 * context must be initialized with XESS_DEBUG_ENABLE_PROFILING flag added to xess_d3d12_init_params_t::initFlags.
 * If profiling is enabled, user must poll for profiling data after executing one or more command lists, otherwise
 * implementation will keep growing internal CPU buffers to accommodate all profiling data available.
 * Due to async nature of execution on GPU, data may not be available after submitting command lists to device queue.
 * It is advised to check `any_profiling_data_in_flight` flag in case all workloads has been submitted, but profiling
 * data for some frames is still not available.
 * Data pointed to by pProfilingData item(s) belongs to context instance and
 * is valid until next call to xessD3D12GetProfilingData or xessGetProfilingData for owning context.
 * @param hContext: The XeSS context handle.
 * @param pProfilingData: pointer to profiling data structure to be filled by implementation.
 * @return XeSS return status code.
