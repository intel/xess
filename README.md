# XeSS SDK

Intel(R) Xe Super Sampling (XeSS) enables an innovative framerate boosting technology supported by Intel(R) Arc(TM) graphics cards and other GPU vendors.
Using AI deep-learning to perform upscaling, XeSS offers higher framerates without degrading the image.

Please see the Developer Guide in the /doc folder for getting started information, https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/arc-discrete-graphics/xess.html for more information, and https://github.com/GameTechDev/XeSSUnrealPlugin for plugin which integrates into Unreal Engine.
